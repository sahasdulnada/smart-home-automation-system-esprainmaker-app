This project is a fully functional smart home automation system designed to control four AC appliances through multiple interfaces, including the ESP RainMaker mobile app, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. The system ensures uninterrupted usability by supporting both online and offline operation—users can control appliances via the internet or through manual physical switches in case of network failure. It also integrates with IoT cloud platforms such as IoT Cloud and Firebase, allowing data storage, device synchronization, and extended monitoring capabilities. To enhance user experience, the system includes an OLED display and dedicated LED indicators that provide real-time status updates for each connected appliance. This combination of cloud connectivity, voice control, local override, and live feedback makes the project a robust, scalable, and user-friendly home automation solution.
